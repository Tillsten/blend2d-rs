# blend2d-rs

This crate provides rust bindings to the 
[blend2d](https://github.com/blend2d/blend2d) lib. This project is 
currently WIP and very incomplete, so the API will most likely change a 
few times until it somewhat stabilizes. Bear in mind that blend2d itself 
is also still in beta, meaning the api can change at any moment. This also 
means that some functionality is still not correctly implemented


This crate is highly experimental and not quite in a useable state yet, though examples already exist.

## Setup

This crate requires [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to be installed and available on `PATH`.

Also make sure to initialize the submodules after cloning the repository(`git submodule update --init`).
