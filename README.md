# blend2d-rs

This crate provides rust bindings to the 
[blend2d](https://github.com/blend2d/blend2d) lib. This project is 
currently WIP and very incomplete, so the API will most likely change a 
few times until it somewhat stabilizes. Bear in mind that blend2d itself 
is also still in mind, meaning it can cause breaking changes when the 
library devs feel like it as well.
